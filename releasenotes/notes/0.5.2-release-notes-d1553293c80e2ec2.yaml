    This release is a bugfix release that primarily fixes compatibility with
    numpy 1.20.0. It is also the first release to include support for Python
    3.9. Earlier releases (including 0.5.0 and 0.5.1) worked with Python 3.9
    but did not indicate this in the package metadata, and there was no upstream
    testing for those releases. This release fixes that and was tested on
    Python 3.9 (in addition to 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8).

    `networkx <https://networkx.org/>`__ is explicitly listed as a dependency
    now. It previously was an implicit dependency as it was required for the
    :mod:`qiskit.ignis.verification.topological_codes` module but was not
    correctly listed as a depdendency as qiskit-terra also requires networkx
    and is also a depdency of ignis so it would always be installed in practice.
    However, it is necessary to list it as a requirement for future releases
    of qiskit-terra that will not require networkx. It's also important to
    correctly list the dependencies of ignis in case there were a future
    incompatibility between version requirements.
